                                Whether it's at school or university,
                                the one thing no one ever teaches you is how to teach yourself. All you actually
                                o is memorize information in order to regurgitate when you take the test. You get
                                drilled on how to solve specific exercises so that while you know exactly what you
                                need to do when exam time comes around, do you truly understand the subject material?
                                All you've really learned is how to pass that one test. Once that test is over,
                                the information in your head has outlived its usefulness.

                                but for some reason, this point is too often overlooked.
                                So, what can we do to remedy this?
